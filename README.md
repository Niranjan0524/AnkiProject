The Anki-like project is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, manage, and review flashcards for efficient learning through spaced repetition. It includes features like adding flashcards with customizable fields (type, deck, front, back, and tags), user authentication for personalized decks, and a modern interface built with React. The project connects to a MySQL database to store user data and flashcard details, ensuring a smooth and structured study experience.
